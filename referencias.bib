There are various implementations of erasure coding available in the research community. Jerasure is one of the widely used open-source library in erasure coding. In this paper, we compared various implementations of Jerasure library in encoding and decoding scenario. Our goal is to compare codes with different filesystems data to understand its impact on code performance. The number of failure scenarios is evaluated to understand performance characteristics of Jerasure code implementation.",

abstract = {Benchmarking is critical when evaluating performance, but is especially difficult for file and storage systems. Complex interactions between I/O devices, caches, kernel daemons, and other OS components result in behavior that is rather difficult to analyze. Moreover, systems have different features and optimizations, so no single benchmark is always suitable. The large variety of workloads that these systems experience in the real world also adds to this difficulty.In this article we survey 415 file system and storage benchmarks from 106 recent papers. We found that most popular benchmarks are flawed and many research papers do not provide a clear indication of true performance. We provide guidelines that we hope will improve future performance evaluations. To show how some widely used benchmarks can conceal or overemphasize overheads, we conducted a set of experiments. As a specific example, slowing down read operations on ext2 by a factor of 32 resulted in only a 2--5percent wall-clock slowdown in a popular compile benchmark. Finally, we discuss future work to improve file system and storage benchmarking.},

abstract = {KnowSeq R/Bioc package is designed as a powerful, scalable and modular software focused on automatizing and assembling renowned bioinformatic tools with new features and functionalities. It comprises a unified environment to perform complex gene expression analyses, covering all the needed processing steps to identify a gene signature for a specific disease to gather understandable knowledge. This process may be initiated from raw files either available at well-known platforms or provided by the users themselves, and in either case coming from different information sources and different Transcriptomic technologies. The pipeline makes use of a set of advanced algorithms, including the adaptation of a novel procedure for the selection of the most representative genes in a given multiclass problem. Similarly, an intelligent system able to classify new patients, providing the user the opportunity to choose one among a number of well-known and widespread classification and feature selection methods in Bioinformatics, is embedded. Furthermore, KnowSeq is engineered to automatically develop a complete and detailed HTML report of the whole process which is also modular and scalable. Biclass breast cancer and multiclass lung cancer study cases were addressed to rigorously assess the usability and efficiency of KnowSeq. The models built by using the Differential Expressed Genes achieved from both experiments reach high classification rates. Furthermore, biological knowledge was extracted in terms of Gene Ontologies, Pathways and related diseases with the aim of helping the expert in the decision-making process. KnowSeq is available at Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/KnowSeq), GitHub (https://github.com/CasedUgr/KnowSeq) and Docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/casedugr/knowseq).}
