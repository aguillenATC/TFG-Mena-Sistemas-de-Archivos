abstract = {The ninth edition of Operating System Concepts continues to evolve to provide a solid theoretical foundation for understanding operating systems. This edition has been updated with more extensive coverage of the most current topics and applications, improved conceptual coverage and additional content to bridge the gap between concepts and actual implementations. A new design allows for easier navigation and enhances reader motivation. Additional end-of-chapter, exercises, review questions, and programming exercises help to further reinforce important concepts. WileyPLUS, including a test bank, self-check exercises, and a student solutions manual, is also part of the comprehensive support package.}

isbn = {0672329468},
publisher = {Addison-Wesley Professional},
edition = {3rd},
abstract = {Linux Kernel Development details the design and implementation of the Linux kernel, presenting the content in a manner that is beneficial to those writing and developing kernel code, as well as to programmers seeking to better understand the operating system and become more efficient and productive in their coding. The book details the major subsystems and features of the Linux kernel, including its design, implementation, and interfaces. It covers the Linux kernel with both a practical and theoretical eye, which should appeal to readers with a variety of interests and needs. The author, a core kernel developer, shares valuable knowledge and experience on the 2.6 Linux kernel. Specific topics covered include process management, scheduling, time management and timers, the system call interface, memory addressing, memory management, the page cache, the VFS, kernel synchronization, portability concerns, and debugging techniques. This book covers the most interesting features of the Linux 2.6 kernel, including the CFS scheduler, preemptive kernel, block I/O layer, and I/O schedulers. The third edition of Linux Kernel Development includes new and updated material throughout the book: An all-new chapter on kernel data structures Details on interrupt handlers and bottom halves Extended coverage of virtual memory and memory allocation Tips on debugging the Linux kernel In-depth coverage of kernel synchronization and locking Useful insight into submitting kernel patches and working with the Linux kernel community}

abstract="Over the past few years, erasure coding has been widely used as an efficient fault tolerance mechanism in distributed storage systems. There are various implementations of erasure coding available in the research community. Jerasure is one of the widely used open-source library in erasure coding. In this paper, we compared various implementations of Jerasure library in encoding and decoding scenario. Our goal is to compare codes with different filesystems data to understand its impact on code performance. The number of failure scenarios is evaluated to understand performance characteristics of Jerasure code implementation.",
